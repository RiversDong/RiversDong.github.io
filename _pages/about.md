I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, [UETSC], (https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). One-half year ago, I performed studies in [CEFG group] (http://cefg.uestc.cn/). At that time, I mainly developed algorithms to identified key elements in bacterial genomes.
Now I'm studied at Manyuan's Lab ([LongLab](http://longlab.uchicago.edu/) in University of Chicago ([UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/)). My study interest is how genes with novel functions originate. Many evolutionary related species are posted in public databases, therefore we can identify young genes in larger scale, which can help us answer the question, so thanks for the development of sequencing technology.
Recently, I made important progress in the understanding of scientific research in that I'm convinced that the scientific problem is the key that scientists have to care most. Thanks for my mentor's guidance.
